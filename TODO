TODO for gpaint


=========================================================================
BUGS

* Clear is broken after the flip operation.

* Rotate operation asserts.


=========================================================================
New Features

* Paint Brush Tool - select different kinds of brush tips.
  Note: square brush is the only tip now.

* Following xpaint, the "image processing" routines need dialog boxes to
  allow users to change certain parameters. (Right now the parameters are
  hard coded to certain default value, not adjustible by the user.)

* We want fill patterns and line widths selectable by the user. (Right
  now there is a crude line width select control and no fill pattern
  dialog box.) 

* Printing--right now there is little or no printing control (user
  interfaces)--we may borrow the code from eog for this.

* Help Topics - online user documentation

* Spray Paint Tool - The spray can tool, also known as the airbrush.

* Undo Feature - Should be able to undo and redo changes to the drawing.

* Background Color Selection - Should be able to right click on a color
  palette to select the current background color.

* Cursors - Need better mouse cursors to indicate the current selected
  tool, and to indicate the area to be changed. For example, the eraser
  cursor should show which pixels will be erased. Currently there is a
  cross hair, which shows just the center of the area.

* Tool Bar Icons - I would like to see nicer icons for some of the
  tools. 

* Blocking Operations - Some menu selections, such as grabbing the
  desktop and some of the image processing functions, take a very long
  time. When these functions are running, the application is not
  responsive and the main window does not repaint after the menu pop up
  is dismissed. Could these time expensive tasks be processed in "the
  background"?

* File Formats - It would be nice to be able to select the format type
  in the save dialog.

* Save Confirmation - The application should prompt the user to save
  unchanged images when exiting. Well maybe it could be optional.

* Zoom - Fixed size zoom (like the "fat bits" feature of xpaint,
  set to 1:6)


=========================================================================
Future Release

* GNOME 2

* adding variable zooming to the image window (like xpaint can do)

* Make gpaint a bonobo component

=========================================================================
Done

* Black background bug
  - initial image was black, now is white
  - background color selector was black, now white

* Invisible rubberbanding when drawing black shapes on white background

* fixed crash on empty cut/copy/paste

* Main window
  - too small initial image
  - not placed entirely on screen (center in ui.c)
  - smoother initial show

* Main Menu
  - simpler layout and names
  - removed unfinished items

* Eraser Tool - interpolation fixed 
  Note: still need to work on tool objects.

* Brush Tool - square brush with interpolation
