Description: GNU Paint - a small, easy to use paint program for GNOME
 This is gpaint (GNU Paint), a small-scale painting program for GNOME,
 the GNU Desktop Environment. gpaint does not attempt to compete with
 GIMP, it is just a simple drawing package based on xpaint, along the
 lines of 'Paintbrush' from a popular non-free operating system.
 .
 Currently gpaint has the following features:
   * Drawing tools such as ovals, freehand, polygon and text, with
     fill or shadow for polygons and closed freehand shapes.
   * Cut and paste by selecting irregular regions or polygons.
   * Preliminary print support using gnome-print.
   * Modern, ease-to-use user interface with tool and color palettes.
   * Multiple-image editing in a single instance of the program.
   * All the image processing features present in xpaint.
