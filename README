This is gpaint (GNU Paint) version 0.3.1, a small-scale painting program for
GNOME, the GNU Desktop.  Gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP.  Think of
GIMP is like Photoshop as gpaint is like Windows Paint.

Gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being developed. 
However, gpaint is usable already for simple image editing..  


Changes in this version:

    * patch 3838 from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson> for updated pt_BR translation
    * patch 3839 from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson> for eliminating gcc warnings
    * patch 5700, from Yavor Doganov <yavor>, New Bulgarian (bg) translation
    * patch 5746, from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson> , German translation
    * patch 5894, from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson> for Use GtkFileChooser for the open and save dialogs; also some fix for the German translation
    * patch 5895, from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson> implementing rectangular selection
    * patch from Yavor Doganov <yavor> fixing bug 18842; also fixing the modal dialog when opening a file fails

Currently gpaint has the following features:
   * Drawing tools--ovals, freehand, polygon, text, with fill or shallow for 
     polygons and closed freehand, and brushes.
   * Cut and paste by selecting regions or polygons.
   * Print support using gnome-print (basic functionality is there) 
   * Modern, ease-to-use user interface with tool and color palettes
   * Editing multiple image at the same time without running multiple instance
     of the image editor
   * All image processing features present in xpaint

This version of gpaint requires the GNOME 2.0 environment.  This version uses
the gdk-pixbuf library to handle image loading and saving.  Currently
gdk-pixbuf's image saving capabilities are limited, with BUGGY support for only
JPEG and PNG formats.  So currently gpaint's image saving is subject to the same
limitations.

A large part of gpaint is derived from xpaint 2.4.9, authored by David Koblas
and later Torsten Martinsen.  

The gpaint project is hosted on the GNU Savannah project site.

Future development plans:

I plan to incorporate the recent printing features of gtk+ and to move away from
gnomeprint.  Utilizing libglade and pango are the immediate next steps.  Also
planned is the incorporation of a small extension language in the code base to
support high level app logic.
