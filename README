This is gpaint (GNU Paint) version 0.3.3, a small-scale painting program for
GNOME, the GNU Desktop.  Gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP.  Think of
GIMP is like Photoshop as gpaint is like Windows Paint.

Gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being developed. 
However, gpaint is usable already for simple image editing..  


Changes in this version:

   * Switch to using libglade; now libglade is a requirement for gpaint
   * some UI adjustment in dialogs to fit the GNOME convention; using the Gtk+
     standard about box
   * Using GtkPrint to do printing when gtk+ version is >= 2.10; only basic
     support is in place for now

Currently gpaint has the following features:
   * Drawing tools--ovals, freehand, polygon, text, with fill or shallow for 
     polygons and closed freehand, and brushes.
   * Cut and paste by selecting regions or polygons.
   * Print support using gnome-print (basic functionality is there) 
   * Modern, ease-to-use user interface with tool and color palettes
   * Editing multiple image at the same time without running multiple instance
     of the image editor
   * All image processing features present in xpaint

This version of gpaint requires the GNOME 2.0 environment.  This version uses
the gdk-pixbuf library to handle image loading and saving.   So currently
gpaint's image saving is limited to the formats supported by gdk-pixbuf.

Gpaint now uses Pango to do text drawing.  Currently English multi-line texts
work; non-English languages are not tested and input methods like SCIM are not
yet properly supported; this is to be addressed.

A large part of gpaint is derived from xpaint 2.4.9, authored by David Koblas
and later Torsten Martinsen.  

The gpaint project is hosted on the GNU Savannah project site.

Future development plans:

I plan to incorporate the recent printing features of gtk+ and to move away from
gnomeprint.  Ehnancing international text support using Pango is the immediate
next steps.  Dialogs to set the parameters for the xpaint-derived image
processing functions are planned. Also planned is the incorporation of a small
extension language in the code base to support high level app logic.
