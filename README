Note to package maintainers: This version is not a drop-in replacement for the
previous releases of gpaint, due to dependencies on different versions of GNOME
platforms.  To avoid confusion, this release uses the name "gpaint-2"

This is gpaint (GNU Paint), a small-scale painting program for GNOME, the GNU
Desktop.  Gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP.  Think of GIMP is like
Photoshop as gpaint is like Windows Paint.

Gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being developed. 
However, gpaint is usable already for simple image editing..  

Currently gpaint has the following features:
   * Drawing tools--ovals, freehand, polygon, text, with fill or shallow for 
     polygons and closed freehand, and brushes.
   * Cut and paste by selecting regions or polygons.
   * Print support using gnome-print (basic functionality is there) 
   * Modern, ease-to-use user interface with tool and color palettes
   * Editing multiple image at the same time without running multiple instance
     of the image editor
   * All image processing features present in xpaint

This version of gpaint requires the GNOME 2.0 environment. To allow concurrent
installation of GNOME 1.4 and GNOME 2 versions of gpaint, the binary for
this gpaint is named "gpaint-2." This version uses the gdk-pixbuf library to
handle image loading and saving.  Currently gdk-pixbuf's image saving
capabilities are limited, with BUGGY support for only JPEG and PNG formats.  So
currently gpaint's image saving is subject to the same limitations.

A large part of gpaint is derived from xpaint 2.4.9, authored by David Koblas
and later Torsten Martinsen.  

The gpaint project is hosted on the GNU Savannah project site.
