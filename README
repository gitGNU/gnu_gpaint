This is gpaint (GNU Paint) version 0.3.2, a small-scale painting program for
GNOME, the GNU Desktop.  Gpaint does not attempt to compete with GIMP.  Think of
GIMP is like Photoshop as gpaint is like Windows Paint.

Gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being developed. 
However, gpaint is usable already for simple image editing..  


Changes in this version (patch and bug numbers refer to the bug and task
trackers for gpaint at savannah.gnu.org):

    * patch from Daniel Nylander <yeager>, new Swedish translation, fix for Bug 20144
    * fix for bug 20150, gtk now needs v 2.8 or later
    * patch 6007 from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson> applied; make colorpalette width fixed
    * patch from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson>, updated PR translation
    * patch from Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson>, fix for Bug 20251, gpaint crashed with SIGSEGV in image_from_selection()
    * fix for Bug 20562, patch from Charlie Watson <chunkyq>, fix Crash when 0 is entered as line width
    * patch from Steven McCoy <steven.mccoy@miru.hk>, submitted by Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson>, implements real clipboard copy and paste
    * patch from  Goedson Teixeira Paixao <goedson>, Implement keyboard accelerators for common operations
    * text drawing is now Pango-based; now multiple line text is supported
    * upgrade to GNU GPL v3

Currently gpaint has the following features:
   * Drawing tools--ovals, freehand, polygon, text, with fill or shallow for 
     polygons and closed freehand, and brushes.
   * Cut and paste by selecting regions or polygons.
   * Print support using gnome-print (basic functionality is there) 
   * Modern, ease-to-use user interface with tool and color palettes
   * Editing multiple image at the same time without running multiple instance
     of the image editor
   * All image processing features present in xpaint

This version of gpaint requires the GNOME 2.0 environment.  This version uses
the gdk-pixbuf library to handle image loading and saving.   So currently
gpaint's image saving is limited to the formats supported by gdk-pixbuf.

From this version gpaint uses Pango to do text drawing.  Currently English
multi-line texts work; non-English languages are not tested and input methods
like SCIM are not yet properly supported; this is to be addressed for the next
version.

A large part of gpaint is derived from xpaint 2.4.9, authored by David Koblas
and later Torsten Martinsen.  

The gpaint project is hosted on the GNU Savannah project site.

Future development plans:

I plan to incorporate the recent printing features of gtk+ and to move away from
gnomeprint.  Utilizing libglade and ehnancing international text support using
Pango is the immediate next steps.  Also planned is the incorporation of a small
extension language in the code base to support high level app logic.
